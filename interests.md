## Visual servoing control system {#visual-servoing}

This research focuses on the challenges posed by complex and dynamic operating conditions. The key purpose is to develop visual localization and control algorithms with high accuracy and strong robustness, specifically designed to overcome difficulties like Field-of-View (FoV) occlusion, environmental clutter/interference, and demanding real-time localization requirements.
